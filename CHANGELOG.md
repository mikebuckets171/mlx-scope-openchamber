# Changelog

## 1.1.0

- Make reported runtime process footprint and model allocation visible in Live,
  separate from whole-host memory, with stale status and server-wide scope clear.
- Reuse the existing snapshot and polling cadence; no new service calls or
  runtime monitoring loop.

## 1.0.0

First standalone MLX Scope release for OpenChamber, shared as a one-time personal
project. No future updates are planned; community forks and adaptations are
welcome under the MIT license.

- oMLX request telemetry, prominent prefill remaining and stage estimates,
  context/reuse, host resources, and primary DFlash observed output.
- vllm-mlx request/status observations, plus LM Studio and mlx-lm inventory views
  with explicit limits on unavailable telemetry.
- Existing local provider discovery, custom provider IDs, matched credentials,
  connection selection, and actionable setup states.
- Bounded 30/60-second observations, pinned comparisons, and manually saved
  sanitized summaries; inventory connections can observe host resources.
- OpenChamber panel/full-page view, live theme/typography, session shortcut,
  service diagnostics, clipboard, and append-only draft sharing.
- Self-contained install ZIP, extracted-service verification, synthetic runtime
  contract tests, and Chromium/WebKit interaction coverage.
